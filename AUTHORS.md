AxiSEM3D is being developed by a large, collaborative, and inclusive community. It is based on the original AxiSEM code written by Tarje Nissen-Meyer and the development of AxiSEM3D was led by Kuangdai Leng. 

## Principal developers

This community is led by a group of Principal Developers who are active in developing code, reviewing code, contributing to the documentation, helping users on the online forums and in person, and in many other visible and invisible ways. They are:
