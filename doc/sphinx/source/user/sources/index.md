# Sources


Sources! Perhaps the most important bit of the code. Sources are described in `inparam.source.yaml`. 

Full details on how the source-time functions work in AxiSEM3D are given in the release papers, but just bear in mind that these are very subtly different from those you might have used in other codes (e.g., SPECFEM). 

Let's look through each of the sections in the yaml file.
