# Example

For this example, we will use the files fron the AxiSEM3D repository [examples folder](https://github.com/AxiSEMunity/AxiSEM3D/tree/master/examples). 

From the top level of your AxiSEM3D directory copy the files from `examples/01_S362ANI_EMC_global/input1D` to the folder input:

```bash
cp examples/01_S362ANI_EMC_global/input1D input
```

Run AxiSEM3D:

```bash
./build/axisem3D
```
Your output will look something like:

```
ADD SOME OUTPUT HERE
```

In this AxiSEM3D used as input. files from the default directory input/ and wrote outputs to the default directory output/

See [Tools for Pre- and Post-processing](../processing/index.md) to visualize these results.

Next, let's look at the yaml files. Note that the yaml files are self describing. Here, for brevity, the comments have been removed.
