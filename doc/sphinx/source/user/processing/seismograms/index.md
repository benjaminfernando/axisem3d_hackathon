# Plotting Seismograms

In this section we will assume that you have a series of ASCII (text)
files containing the displacements recorded at the stations that you’re
interested in. As noted previously, netcdf files are much more efficient
and we would recommend them if you are doing much more than generating
basic seismograms. Also, if you are doing wavefield visualisation,
definitely do not try to do this using ASCII!
